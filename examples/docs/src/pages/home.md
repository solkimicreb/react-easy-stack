# React Easy Stack

> A complete routing and state management solution for practical developers.

React Easy Stack was born from years of practical problem solving. It promotes rapid development and puts product quality before theoretical code beauty. Easy Stack apps should effortlessly meet subtle user expectations - like browser history and URL integration, animated page transitions and routing without flashing a cascade of loaders.

### Installation

`npm i react-easy-stack`

Easy Stack supports [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) without additional configuration. Replace `APP_NAME` with your preferred app name and run the following commands to get started.

```bash
npx create-react-app APP_NAME
cd APP_NAME
npm install react-easy-stack
npm start
```

_You need npm 5.2+ to use the [npx](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npx) command._
