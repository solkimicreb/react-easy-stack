# TodoMVC Â· [Live Demo](https://solkimicreb.github.io/react-easy-params/examples/todo-mvc/build)

This is a lighter version of the well-known React [TodoMVC](http://todomvc.com/).

- It handles all of the state in a separate global store and relies heavily on JS getters and setter to provide a clear and simple state management.
- It persists the todos in localStorage and reflects the current filter in the URL query.

Be sure to click all the buttons in the demo.
